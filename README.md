## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Daniil Vakhrushev, a software engineering student with 2 years of hands-on experience in C# development. Passionate about software development, problem-solving, and scalable system design, I have a strong foundation in programming principles and software architecture.

I began my journey in 2020, developing projects in C# and Unity, and have since expanded my expertise into software engineering beyond game development. My technical skills include:
âœ… Programming Languages: C#, Java, Python, SQL, Oracle SQL
âœ… Software Development Principles: OOP, SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI
âœ… Technologies & Tools: Git, Unity 2D/3D, system architecture, UI implementation, localization, and design patterns

I have experience developing both desktop and mobile applications and continuously seek to expand my knowledge of new tools, frameworks, and best practices in modern software engineering.

Now, after moving to Israel, I am actively looking for new opportunities as a software engineer, eager to contribute my skills to innovative projects in a collaborative environment.

Letâ€™s connect and create something impactful together! ðŸš€
