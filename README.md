## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Daniil Vakhrushev, Ð¼otivated Unity developer with love for games and passion to develop them. I'm interested in desining and implementing different gameplay systems. For me it is very inspiring to see how different pieces come together to become an interesting and engaging game, that was created by me.  

Around 2020 I started developing games on Unity, and now I continue to study and develop.

My main skills are C# programming and using different tools and systems Unity engine offers. I am familiar with all the basic tools of the engine. Have experience working with animations, UI, localization system, particle system, Scriptable Objects and basic design patterns,
Have expirience in building pc and mobile games both 3D and 2D. 
Familiar with code style (OOP, SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI), Git (GitHub) version control system.

I also try to grow as a programmer and discover and learn new tools, systems snf spproaches created for unity by other developers. Now, due to moving to Israel and aquiring citizenship, I am looking for new opportunities as a Unity developer.
